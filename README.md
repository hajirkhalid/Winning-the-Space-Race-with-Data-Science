# Winning-the-Space-Race-with-Data-Science
This is the Applied Data Science Capstone Project for the IBM PC. The project aims to predict the prices of SpaceX launches as will as whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

SpaceX Falcon 9's first stage landing is an important predictor of the cost of a launch. SpaceX advertises a launch cost of 62 million dollars, whereas its competitors provide a launch of 165 million dollars. The savings in the cost launch are attributed to SpaceX's ability to resuse the first stage.​

SpaceY would like to compete with SpaceX in the commercial space travel race. This project aims to answer the following questions:​

What is the price of each launch?​

Will SpaceX reuse the first stage?​
